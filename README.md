# Travelling salesman problem with evolutionary algorithm

Experimenting with genetic algorithm for solving the travelling salesman problem in comparison with other search algorithms
(e.g., exhaustive search, hil climbing).<br>
<br>
The methods for mutation, combination, ranking, selection are chosen with the consideration of e.g., the nature of the problem,
the structure of the chromosome (permutation), avoiding the early divergence, balancing between exploration and exploitation.<br>
<br>
I used numpy for holding the chromosomes and pandas for storing the related information for each generation 
(e.g., the best individual, minimum distance, ranking of populations).<br>
<br>
The data used for this project is the 48 states of the contiguous United States of America (att48).<br>
